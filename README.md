#  1.
Write a program that stores the
frequency of each letter of the alphabet from a paragraph (which is also stored in a file) into a 1-D array. (hint: ASCII value of 'a' is 97, if x is any letter in the paragraph and my_array is the array then my_array[x - 97]++ can be used for counting)
# 2.
Write a program that takes a set of
integers from a file and prints the minimum of the integers into another file. (hint: initialize a variable with a very large number like int my_var = 9999999999999999999, now compare each element of the array with that number, each time if the element of the array is having the small value, assign the small value
to the my_var)
